# Task 3 
### Difficulty level _**Hard**_.

## Logistic Regression with Gradient Descent

**_Note: Kindly only use the packages and the steps that have been given below and refrain from using libraries like sklearn and tensorflow when performing this task._** 

You are required to perform the following tasks:

1. Install the following packages:
   1. matplotlib
   2. pandas
   3. numpy
2. Read the dataset 'task3.csv' available in this repository.
3. Perform gradient Descent on the data using sigmoid function and assume your weights to be (m1,m2,b). Calculate the slope and intersect for every 'patientId'.
4. Run the iterations in a loop and train your Gradient Descent.
5. Plot a Cost vs Iteration Graph that shows how the cost has been minimized with the number of iterations. 
6. Calculate decision boundary line and plot it. (This step is optional but a plus point)
