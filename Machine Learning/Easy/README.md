# Task 1 
### Difficulty level _**Easy**_. <br>
## Application of Basic Linear Regression and plot. Performed on Google Collab. <br>
_Note: Kindly only use the packages and the steps that have been given below._ <br>

You are required to perform the following tasks:
1. Install the following packages: 
   1. numpy
   2. matplotlib
   3. pandas
   <br>
2. Read the dataset of the company of your choice out of the given [datasets](https://github.com/piyushchandra357/tj-ml-task/tree/main/Task%201/datasets).
3. Apply linear regression over the 'Open' and 'Last' column Values of the stock data given in the dataset.
4. Plot a standard graph using matplotlib. Use yellow color for the scatter and red color for the regression line. Make sure to label the X and Y axis according to the column names.
<br>
How to submit: Run all the cells in the collab notebook and make sure the output is present. Then, submit the link of the notebook. Make sure you have enabled sharing.

##### PS - You are free to perform Multi-linear Regression if you wish to. Might gives an advantage.
